# Writeup: 3D-Object Detection
# Midterm project

### Finding examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud then identify vehicle features that appear stable in most of the inspected examples and describing them


we have our point cloud here and we will search for the vehicles

First we searched in the vehicle nearby our lidar from the back and as shown the cars are visible enough specially the front of the cars

We then searched in the vehicles nearby our lidar from the front and we can see that the car is very visbile specially from behind

but as we continue searching we can see that vehicles behind this car is not visible enough as there is alot of lidar points that didn't reach the vehicle as shown in this observation

And this keeping happening we all the cars in the same row as shown

the same thing goes with objects far away from us the liser doesn't reach the object because of the deviation angle of the lidar so those objects are not visible enough

Other vehciles also visible enough like trucks, as shown
